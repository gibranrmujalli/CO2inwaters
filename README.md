# CO2inwaters
This function of Python will calculate the pCO2 in waters considering an open system with respect to CO2.
The function will return the calculated pCO2 by using alkalinity and by using DIC.
The recomended calculated value is by using DIC (which includes the alkalinity in IS)
The values are log10(atm).
